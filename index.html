		<h2>Devices</h2>
		<p>eInk readers are devices designed to mimic the experience of reading on a regular piece of paper. 
		They have with high res, low-glare screens which last for months before needing to be charged and can carry a user's entire library.
		</p>
		
		<p>In 2010 I started working on Kobo's first eInk device. Soon after, "The Kobo" was born. 
		It had a big blue button and it would sync your library via bluetooth from a Blackberry device. 
		Over the next four years, I helped create 8 eReaders which got bigger, faster and prettier.
		</p>

		<p> The device is built using C++ and the Qt framework and runs on top of Linux. 
		Having been on the project from the very beginning gave me an opportunity to work on pretty much every aspect of it.
		In particular, I've spent a bunch of time working on the persistance layer (including a custom cache) and the syncing component. 
		I've also helped improve the speed and reliability of opening books and wifi connectivity.

		<h2>Phone Apps</h2>
		<p>
		Android is an operating system built by Google, which today powers more mobile devices than Windows and iOS combined.
		</p>

		<p>In spring 2008, I built a prototype Android application which I used as part of a pitch to Y Combinator.
		While they didn't like us enough to fund us, I became a big believer in Android as a platform.
		Later in 2008, I prototyped the original Kobo(at the time called Shortcovers) phone app for Android. 
		I eventually started working on it full time and released it to the public early 2009.
		</p>

		<p>
		Since then, I've been playing with apps in my spare time. I've published over three dozen free, simple applications which have been downloaded by millions of users.

		<h2>Websites</h2>
		<p>My first experience with websites, was rewritting the reporting framework for the Tivoli Provisioning Manager from scratch.
		The project made heavy use of JSPs running on top of WebSphere and backed by DB2.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In my next project, at Marsh Canada, I dove deep into the UI side. I built and extended javascript pages and components, based on YUI and Ajax. 
		In the process I gained a new appreciation for how beautiful javascript code can actually be.
		</p>

		<p>
		At Kobo, I was asked to join a SWAT team focused on improving the performance of the kobobooks.com website, in order to handle expected huge spikes in traffic.
		The site is powered by .NET, backed by MS SQL and runs on IIS. We transitioned to a service oriented architecture and started using Membase (now Couchbase) 
		while also doing various refactoring work to improve performance. The project was a success, as the website performed well even at peak traffic spikes.
		</p>

		<p>
		I continue occasionally building websites on the side, to try to stay on top of emerging trends and technologies. One recent example is "idealist". 
		It's a website internal to Kobo built using django, running on apache and backed by postgresql. 
		Essentially it's an image-heavy brainstorming tool that allows employees to submit cool ideas and features we should build.

		<h2>Desktop Applications</h2>
		<p>
		Content is the lifeblood of an eBook company. At Kobo I built the original content processing system. 
		It took books from publishers in various formats, parsed and converted them into a proprietary format to be consumed by our clients.
		The system was built in .NET and backed by MS SQL.
		</p>

		<p>
		Later on while building the eReader devices, my team created the Kobo desktop application. 
		Developed in Linux, it's built with C++ using Qt and runs on Windows as well as OS X.
